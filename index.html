        <div class="about__body">
            <p>My name is Clem, I enjoy using my technical skills, creativity and problem solving to make an impact on the world.
                I have a background in operations, project management, where I developed communication, attention to detail skills and and was able to work well in a team.
                </p>
                <p>My name is Clem, I am a family oriented person who enjoys sports and events in
                    my spare time. I have a strong working background in Operations, and Project management  where I developed strong organization, communication and problem solving skills. I received formal training and certification in Firefighting, Security as well as IT fields.
                    
                    I recently completed a certificate in Full Stack Development with Hyperion Development, I would love the opportunity to learn and develop my skills in the IT field. I am eager to gain as much knowledge of the industry 
                    as humanly possible. 
                    Gaining experience with MSDF Group would be invaluable experience for me.
                    
                    I have previously worked in The fire/rescue and security fields, where I attained skills such as a strong work ethic and attention to detail that compliments my abilities to be a problem solver. 
                    In these roles I was a shift lead, where security and asset protection was the main focus. 
                    Another role was being project manager of a team of 60 for a public works project, which has given me the ability to work as a team, communicate with diverse groups of people and be flexible and adaptable when the situation demands, as well as manage projects efficiently. 
                    
                    I believe I can be an asset to your team by using my abilities that include : sense of responsibility, problem solving, communication skills and trustworthiness.
                    </p>
            <p>I recently graduated from HyperionDev Full Stack Web developer bootcamp and I also constantly research online to improve my knowledge.
                I am looking for any Web developer role where I can gain quality industry experience.</p>
